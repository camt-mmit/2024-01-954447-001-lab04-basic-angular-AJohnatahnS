  <h2>Autobiography</h2>
  <p>
    I was born on a warm, sunny day in June 15 in Chiang Mai, Thailand. I still
    live in Chiang Mai, Thailand, and I go to school at XXX School. I live with
    my mom, Kate; my brother, Jack; and my Aunt Molly. When I was born, my
    brother was fifteen-months-old and hide under the table from me. Jake is a
    sweet kid and he would do anything for me, but like all brothers and sisters
    we fight like cats and dogs. Sometimes when no one was around, Jake would
    come pu to me and bite my toes for no reason. I still love him but only
    because he is my brother.
